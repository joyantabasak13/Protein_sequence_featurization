Current Scenario:
1. Since 2018, A larger (10x) dataset for lysine succ. was published. (older->CPLM, newest->PLMD)
2. Several paper (4-5) worked on PLMD dataset.
3. None of their claimed online repository works nor their code is open source. So even if we get good result, 
	we cannot compare unless we reproduce those works ourselves. 
	We can compare against their reported result but that might be dishonestly fabricated/manipulated.
4. The features we used are already partially used in some of the recently published paper on lysine succ.

Possible short term future direction:
1. Reproduce the best reported CPLM and PLMD tools with PLMD dataset. 
2. It may be possible to publish a Survey paper by in-depth comparing these tools.
3. I had run our pipeline on PLMD data and the results ae more or less similar to their reported results.
	After reproducing them, if our result stands better we might go for publishing. 
4. If our results are not better, we can check search/think/discover/experiment new features. 
	Even if results are comparable (if not better), I think we can go for publishing as we introduced new features in lysine. succ research.

Possible sightly longer term direction:
1. Utilize our developed pipeline for other PTMs (methylation, acetylation,...etc.)

Possible long term direction:
1. Develop an easy to use framework for PTM analysis in general.
