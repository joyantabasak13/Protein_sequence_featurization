Dataset: PLMD Dataset (http://plmd.biocuckoo.org/index.php)
	6377 unique proteins from 12 species contains 88735 lysine instances

Major Step 1: Homology Reduction
		CD-Hit is widely used for this. No other alternative noted in previous works.
		CD-Hit (http://weizhongli-lab.org/cd-hit/) Has online server support in addition to offline tool version

Major Step 2: Dataset Balancing
		Possible Prerequisite: windowsized protein sub-strings, feature matrix. 
		Dataset almost 10:1 negative to positive imbalanced.
		Previously we used KNN Cleaning Treatment. KNN, random balancing, sub-strings homology reduction noted in prev. work.
	A possible pitfall: Are the lysines marked as non-suc completely non-suc or they are potential suc. 
		but appeared non-suc at the time of experimental data collection. 

Major Step 3: Featurization
		Create feature matrix from data
		12 types of features used in literature so far:

Major Step 4: Feature Selection
		In case of large number of features, of which many are not significantly discriminatory, need to reduce feature set.
		Previously used RF importance score (somewhat works), RF/SVM-Recursive feature elimination (Does not work)
	A Good repo: https://jundongl.github.io/scikit-feature/algorithms.html

Major Step 5: Classifier
		RF, SVM, Ensemble, XGBoost, NN are used in prev.work with various hyperparameters and variations.
	A Common trend: For same feature matrix all types of classifiers showed little variation in performance.
